## Overview

This repository showcases my work during my Python internship. It includes solutions to five Level 2 questions that test various aspects of Python programming, such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Questions

The repository contains solutions to the following five questions:

1. **Question 1**: Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user should then try to guess the number. The program should provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed.
2. **Question 2**: Create a number guessing game where the program that generates a random number between a specified range, and the user tries to guess it. Provide feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.
3. **Question 3**: Create a Python Function that evaluates the strength of a password entered by the user. Implement checks for factors such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
4. **Question 4**: Write a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. The function should take an integer input from the user and display the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.
5. **Question 5**: Write a Python program that reads a text file and counts the occurences of each word in the file. Display the results in alphabetical order along with their respective counts.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this repository up and running on your machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clonehttps://github.com/Adnan-Malik-26/cognifyz-internship.git    
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd cognifyz-internship
    ```


## Usage

Run the Python scripts for each question directly from the command line. For example, to run the solution for Question 1:

```sh
python question1.py
```

Each script can be executed similarly by replacing `question1.py` with the corresponding filename.
